# Optimization (`tensorflow`)

## üìñ Introduction
Optimization in TensorFlow enhances model performance and efficiency. This guide covers hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size), regularization (dropout, L2), mixed precision training (`tf.keras.mixed_precision`), and model quantization, with practical examples and interview insights.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Understand hyperparameter tuning for learning rate and batch size.
- Apply regularization techniques like dropout and L2.
- Implement mixed precision training for faster computation.
- Perform model quantization for efficient deployment.

## üîë Key Concepts
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize learning rate and batch size for better accuracy.
- **Regularization**: Use dropout and L2 to prevent overfitting.
- **Mixed Precision Training**: Use `mixed_float16` for faster training on GPUs.
- **Model Quantization**: Reduce model size and latency with TensorFlow Lite.

## üìù Example Walkthrough
The `optimization.py` file demonstrates:
1. **Dataset**: Loading and preprocessing CIFAR-10.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Testing learning rates and batch sizes.
3. **Regularization**: Applying dropout and L2 to a CNN.
4. **Mixed Precision**: Training with `mixed_float16` policy.
5. **Quantization**: Converting a model to TensorFlow Lite.
6. **Visualization**: Comparing accuracy and visualizing tuning results.

Example code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow.keras.mixed_precision as mixed_precision
policy = mixed_precision.Policy('mixed_float16')
mixed_precision.set_global_policy(policy)
model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Tasks
1. Tune learning rate and batch size for a CNN on CIFAR-10 and select the best combination.
2. Add dropout and L2 regularization to a model and compare performance.
3. Train a model with mixed precision and measure training time savings.
4. Quantize a trained model with TensorFlow Lite and evaluate its accuracy.
5. Visualize hyperparameter tuning results using a scatter plot.
