# Specialized TensorFlow Libraries (`tensorflow`)

## üìñ Introduction
TensorFlow‚Äôs specialized libraries streamline data handling, model reuse, and deployment. This guide covers **TensorFlow Datasets**, **TensorFlow Hub**, **Keras**, **TensorFlow Lite**, and **TensorFlow.js**, with practical examples and interview insights.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Load and preprocess datasets with TensorFlow Datasets.
- Use pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub for transfer learning.
- Build models rapidly with Keras.
- Deploy models on edge devices with TensorFlow Lite.
- Prepare models for browser-based inference with TensorFlow.js.

## üîë Key Concepts
- **TensorFlow Datasets**: Curated, ready-to-use datasets with `tfds.load`.
- **TensorFlow Hub**: Pre-trained models for transfer learning via `hub.KerasLayer`.
- **Keras**: High-level API for quick model prototyping.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: Lightweight models for mobile and edge devices.
- **TensorFlow.js**: JavaScript-based ML for browser environments.

## üìù Example Walkthrough
The `specialized_libraries.py` file demonstrates:
1. **TensorFlow Datasets**: Loading CIFAR-10 with preprocessing.
2. **TensorFlow Hub**: Transfer learning with MobileNetV2.
3. **Keras**: Building a CNN for CIFAR-10.
4. **TensorFlow Lite**: Converting and evaluating a model.
5. **TensorFlow.js**: Instructions for browser deployment.
6. **Visualization**: Dataset samples and model predictions.

Example code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
ds, info = tfds.load('cifar10', with_info=True, as_supervised=True)
train_ds = ds['train'].map(lambda x, y: (x / 255.0, tf.one_hot(y, 10))).batch(32)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Tasks
1. Load a dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) using TensorFlow Datasets and preprocess it.
2. Use a TensorFlow Hub model for transfer learning on CIFAR-10.
3. Build and train a Keras model for image classification.
4. Convert a Keras model to TensorFlow Lite and evaluate its accuracy.
5. Prepare a model for TensorFlow.js and outline browser deployment steps.
6. Combine TensorFlow Datasets, Hub, and Keras in a transfer learning workflow.
