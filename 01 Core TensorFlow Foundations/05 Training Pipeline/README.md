# Training Pipeline (`tensorflow`)

## üìñ Introduction
A training pipeline orchestrates model training, evaluation, checkpointing, and monitoring in TensorFlow. This guide covers training/evaluation loops, model checkpointing (`model.save`, `model.load`), GPU/TPU training (`tf.device`), and monitoring with TensorBoard, with practical examples and interview insights.

## üéØ Learning Objectives
- Understand TensorFlow‚Äôs training and evaluation loops.
- Master model checkpointing for saving and loading models.
- Implement GPU/TPU training with `tf.device`.
- Monitor training with TensorBoard for performance analysis.

## üîë Key Concepts
- **Training/Evaluation Loops**: Custom loops using `tf.GradientTape` for fine-grained control.
- **Model Checkpointing**: Save and load models with `model.save` and `model.load`.
- **GPU/TPU Training**: Use `tf.device` to leverage hardware accelerators.
- **TensorBoard**: Visualize metrics (loss, accuracy) during training.

## üìù Example Walkthrough
The `training_pipeline.py` file demonstrates:
1. **Dataset**: Loading and preprocessing MNIST with `tf.data.Dataset`.
2. **Model**: Building a CNN for digit classification.
3. **Training Loop**: Custom loop with `tf.GradientTape` and TensorBoard logging.
4. **Checkpointing**: Saving and loading the model.
5. **GPU/TPU Training**: Training on available hardware using `tf.device`.
6. **TensorBoard**: Logging metrics for visualization.
7. **Visualization**: Plotting training loss and accuracy.

Example code:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
model = tf.keras.Sequential([...])
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam()
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()

@tf.function
def train_step(x, y):
    with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
        logits = model(x, training=True)
        loss = loss_fn(y, logits)
    gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
    optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))
    return loss
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Practical Tasks
1. Implement a custom training loop for a CNN on MNIST using `tf.GradientTape`.
2. Save and load a trained model using `model.save` and `model.load`.
3. Train a model on GPU/CPU using `tf.device` and verify device placement.
4. Set up TensorBoard to monitor loss and accuracy during training.
5. Use `ModelCheckpoint` callback to save the best model based on validation accuracy.

## üí° Interview Tips
- **Common Questions**:
  - How does a custom training loop differ from `model.fit`?
  - What is the purpose of `ModelCheckpoint` callback?
  - How do you ensure efficient GPU training in TensorFlow?
- **Tips**:
  - Explain the role of `tf.GradientTape` in custom loops.
  - Highlight TensorBoard‚Äôs utility for debugging and optimization.
  - Be ready to code a training loop or set up TensorBoard logging.
